# Git Homework Repository
This repository is to demonstrate various Git commands and best practices. The project showcases how to initialize a Git repository, create and manage branches, resolve merge conflicts, and more. Additionally, the project includes a simple webpage that introduces our team, with details such as names, emails, and additional modifications throughout the project lifecycle.

## Features
- **Git Initialization and Project Setup:** Created a Git repository, added standard project files such as `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `.gitignore`, `INSTALL.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`.
- **Branch Management:** Demonstrated the creation and usage of feature branches for developing new features (e.g., adding a footer to the website).
- **Merge Conflict Simulation and Resolution:** Created and resolved a merge conflict between the `main` and `feature` branches by consolidating changes to the webpage footer.
- **Commit History and Reversion:** Managed version control effectively by reviewing commit history, reverting commits, and making additional changes.
- **Stash and Apply Changes:** Utilized `git stash` to temporarily save work-in-progress changes, switch branches, and apply them back for further development.
